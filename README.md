Pixel Man's Calorie Calculator
==================

Pixel Man's Calorie Calculator is a redesigned version of my previous Pixel Calorie Calculator: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~a0087745/portfolio/swf/CalorieCalculator.swf

Pixel Man's Calorie Calculator uses the Harrisâ€“Benedict equation to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the user. The BMR is multiplied by the activity level selected by the user to calculate his or her daily calorie requirement. The application also calculates the user's body mass index.
